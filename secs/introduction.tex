In the study of programming languages a great number of important
questions can be reduced to questions about the equality of
programs. The verification of a compiler pass is nothing but a
question of equality of the naive program and its optimized version,
an optimized data structure may be shown to be correct relative to a
much simpler reference solution, a type theory hinges on the
construction of definitional equality and so on. Given the role that
equality plays in programming languages, a great variety of
mathematical tools have been developed to analyze the various notions
of equality possible in a programming language.

When in this thesis equality is discussed, it is generally meant to be
\emph{contextual equivalence}. Contextual equivalence is formally
defined later (see
Definition~\ref{defn:language:contextualEquivalence}) but informally
contextual equivalence of two programs, $e_1 \cong e_2$, expresses
that $e_1$ and $e_2$ are internally indistinguishable. This means that
there is no program containing $e_1$ so that if $e_1$ is replaced with
$e_2$ then the program returns a different result. This notion of
equivalence is appealing because there is no aspect of a program we
care about other than how it computes. Contextual equivalence allow to
ignore unimportant differences in the precise way that the answer of a
program is computed and focus instead on the answer itself. This means
that two well-behaved implementations of a data structure, for
instance, are contextually equivalent even if one is far more complex
and efficient than the other.

For all the appeal of contextual equivalence, it is very difficult to
establish that two programs are contextually equivalent. In order to
establish that $e_1 \cong e_2$ it is necessary to quantify over all possible
programs using $e_1$ and $e_2$ and reason about their behavior. This
includes programs which do not really make use of $e_1$ or $e_2$ such
as $\ap{(\lam{x}{\fn{\unit}{\tau}}{1})}{\lam{x}{\unit}{e_1}}$. This
lack of constraints on how $e_1$ or $e_2$ is used is precisely what
makes contextual equivalence so useful but it makes even the most
basic proofs involved affairs. In order to compensate for this, a
variety of tools have been developed to simply the process of
establishing when $e_1 \cong e_2$.

Broadly speaking, there are two classes of these tools. One may
consider denotational approaches, where in the equality of programs is
reduced to the question of the equality of normal mathematical
objects. This line of study begins with Dana Scott's investigations of
the lambda calculus~\citep{TODO-CITE-SCOTT}. These tools have been
immensely effective when they may be applied but they are difficult to
use. Complex programming languages often make use of extremely
sophisticated mathematical objects and using the model requires
understanding them. This has meant that denotational semantics is
traditionally out of reach for the verification of programs by an
average programmer or anyone besides a domain expert.

On the other hand, there are syntactic approaches to equality. Some of
these date back to the original study of the lambda calculus and its
reduction properties. Syntactic tools tend to be simpler to use,
relying only one elementary mathematics and an understanding of the
syntax itself. For equality, the tool of choice when working
syntactically is a logical relation~\citep{TODO-TAIT-AMAL}. Dating
back to~\citet{TODO-TAIT} logical relations crucially define a
type-indexed notion of equality. Logical relations have proven
important for validating certain obviously desirable properties such
as function extensionality. They have also given rise to a powerful
theory of data abstraction called
parametricity~\citep{TODO-REYNOLDS}. Parametric reasoning as inspired
by logical relations has been so important that there have even been
attempts to reconstruct it in a purely abstract denotational
sense~\citep{TODO-FIBRATIONAL}.

To be precise, a logical relation in for us is a family of sets
indexed by the types of the language, $(R_\tau)_\tau$. It is
constructed by induction over the types indexing it so that
$R_{\fn{\tau_1}{\tau_2}}$ is defined in terms of $R_{\tau_1}$ and
$R_{\tau_2}$. For each $\tau$, the following property is expected to
hold:
\[
  (e_1, e_2) \in R_\tau \implies
  \hasE{\cdot}{e_1, e_2}{\tau} \land e_1 \cong e_2
\]
This property expresses the soundness of the logical relation with
regards to contextual equivalence: logical equivalence implies
contextual equivalence. The reverse property, completeness, is
desirable but often unachievable\footnote{Instead a variety of
  techniques for \emph{forcing} completeness to hold are
  employed. These amount to adding all the missing identifications to
  the logical relation. While theoretically desirable, this is useless
  for the problem of actually establishing an
  equivalence.}. Completeness is usually unnecessary for establishing
certain concrete equivalences so in this context it is less
important. Finally, an important property of logical relations which
is difficult to capture formally is that it is much easier to prove
that $(e_1, e_2) \in R_\tau$ than to directly show that
$e_1 \cong e_2$. Typically, $R_\tau$ is meant to capture the logical
action of $\tau$; it expresses the precise set of observations
possible to make of expressions of type $\tau$ without all the
duplication of contextual equivalence. For instance, in order to show
that $(e_1, e_2) \in R_{\fn{\tau_1}{\tau_2}}$ it suffices to show the
following.
\[
  \forall (a_1, a_2) \in R_{\tau_1}.
  \ (\ap{e_1}{a_1}, \ap{e_2}{a_2}) \in R_{\tau_2}
\]
Given the obvious appeal of having a logical relation defined for a
language, it would seem that the construction of a logical relation
characterizing equality is a natural first step in the study of a new
programming language. The central stumbling block to this goal is that
logical relations are difficult to extend to new programming languages
and especially to new types and computational effects.

For an instance of where trouble might arise, consider a language with
polymorphic types: $\allNoKind{\alpha}{\tau}$. What should the
definition of $R_{\allNoKind{\alpha}{\tau}}$ be? Phrased different,
the question is when are two polymorphic functions
indistinguishable. One might expect a definition like the following.
\[
  (e_1, e_2) \in R_{\allNoKind{\alpha}{\tau}} \defs
  \forall \tau'.\ (\Ap{e_1}{\tau'}, \Ap{e_2}{\tau'}) \in R_{[\tau'/\alpha]\tau}
\]
This does correctly characterize contextual equivalence but it is
ill-suited as a definition in a logical relation because it will not
be well-founded. A logical relation is constructed by induction on the
types and with impredicative polymorphism there is absolutely no
reason why $\tau'$ should be smaller than
$\allNoKind{\alpha}{\tau}$. This is not a minor issue, defining a
correct logical relation for a language with impredicative
polymorphism requires the novel method of
candidates~\citep{TODO-GIRARD}. This problem has been a recurring
issue: features in programming languages tend to have some recursive
structure which prevents them from easily fitting into the inductive
definition of a logical relation. For many features clever
constructions have been found which circumvent well-foundedness
issues: for parametric polymorphism~\citep{TODO-GIRARD}, for
first-order state~\citep{TODO-PITTS-AND-STARK}, simple
exceptions~\citep{TODO-I-DUNNO-SURELY-NOT-NUPRL}, and for recursive
types~\citep{TODO-CRARY-AND-HARPER}. Despite this work logical
relations are still a long way away from being able to cope with a
full programming language. The state of the art for dealing with
features like higher-order references, nontrivial control passing, or
concurrency is to use step-indexing.

Step-indexing is a technique first proposed by \citet{TODO-APPEL}. It
is based on a simple but ingenious idea: if you the logical relation
is not well-defined by induction on the type just add a number which
decreases and induct on that. This idea means that a logical relation
is no longer a type-indexed relation but a relation indexed by a
number (called a \emph{step}) and a type, $(R_\tau^i)_{i, \tau}$. The
meaning of a relation at step $i$ and type $\tau$ is that two programs
are related if they are indistinguishable at type $\tau$ for $i$
steps. Two programs are related for $i$ steps intuitively if it will
take at least $i$ steps to tell them apart. For instance, if a program
$e_1$ runs to $\tt$ in 10 steps while $e_2$ runs to false in 20, it
takes 20 steps to distinguish them since we must wait for $e_2$ to
finish running before they can be compared. This idea of steps has
proven to be incredibly robust and easily extend to many different
settings~\citep{TODO-SUCCESSES-OF-STEP-INDEXING}. There is a price to
be payed for this extra flexibility. Firstly, steps will now pervade
the definition of the logical relation and any proof now must contain
pointless bookkeeping activity in order to keep track of
them. Secondly, the evaluation behavior of the programs under
consideration has begun to matter again. The goal of contextual
equivalence was to erase it from consideration but now there are
instances where in order to use a logical relation a program must be
modified with spurious NO-OP statements in order to make it take extra
steps. These issues are even present when just using the logical
relation to validate contextual
equivalences~\citep{TODO-TRANSFINITE}. In practice, this has meant
that while step-indexing is incredibly widely used it is almost
universally disliked\footnote{Citation: I walked around at POPL and
  the 5 people I asked seemed like REALLY bummed about it.}.

The structure of this thesis as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:language}
an ML-like language is described that will serve as target for the
logical relation. In Section~\ref{sec:step-indexing} a step-indexed
logical relation for this language is constructed and discussed,
especially to highlight its short-comings. In
Section~\ref{sec:domains} the first failed step-index-free logical
relation is described, the most naive approach centered around using
domain theory. In Section~\ref{sec:handedness} a variety a number of
step-index-free logical relations are discussed for languages powerful
enough to encode general references, largely built around (guarded)
recursive kinds.
