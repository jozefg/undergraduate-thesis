\section{An ML-like Language with General References}\label{sec:language}

In order to make the discussion of logical relations more concrete, a
particular language is necessary. In this section we develop a core
calculus suitable for studying the effects of general references on
reasoning.

The language under consideration here is heavily influenced by the
Modernized Algol discussed by Harper~\citep{Harper:16}. It features a
syntactic separation between commands and expressions. Expressions are
characterized by being unable to depend on in any way on the
heap. Commands may modify the heap using assignables, a mutable
``variable'' that makes clear the binding structure (nominal rather
than substitutive). A crucial component of the system is a modality
for internalizing and suspending commands to treat them as
expressions. Arguably this language is heavier-weight than the ML-like
languages usually discussed; normally languages considered allow
imperative computation anywhere in the program. A language with
isolated commands has the advantage that handling state is now a
question of defining the logical action of the command
modality. Normally the complexity of state is is not littered
throughout the full logical relation. Indeed, the definitions of the
logical relation at $\to$ or $\forall$ are almost completely
unchanged.

The syntax of our language has three sorts: commands, expressions, and
types defined by the following grammar.
\[
  \begin{array}{lcl}
    \tau & ::= & \alpha \mid \fn{\tau}{\tau} \mid \allNoKind{\alpha}{\tau}
    \mid \cmd{\tau}\\
    c & ::= & \ret{e} \mid \get{\alpha} \mid \set{\alpha}{e} \\
      & \mid & \dcl{\alpha}{e}{c} \mid \bnd{x}{e}{c}\\
    e & ::= & x \mid \ap{e}{e} \mid \lam{x}{\tau}{e} \mid
              \LamNoKind{\alpha}{e} \mid \cmd{e}
  \end{array}
\]
Only one point of this syntax must be clarified, which is the
unfortunate coincidence of $\alpha$s. In an attempt to maintain
consistency with the standard literature on System F and Harper's
Modernaized Algol $\alpha$ here refers either to an assignable (a
symbol) or a type variable.

A crucial point of this language is that assignables are \emph{not}
variables. Assignables are bound by the operators of our language and
they do $\alpha$-vary as a variable might but you can not substitute
for an assignable. This justifies comparing bound symbols for
equality; they are less placeholders and more pointers to binders. It
is nonsensical to talk about a rule like the following.
\[
  \inferrule{ }{\step{\dcl{\alpha}{v}{c}}{[v/\alpha]c}}
\]
This is similar to the confusion that many programmers have when
discussing languages with ``variables'': C-like languages do not
permit substitution because they do not possess variables but rather
assignables. In C a rule like the above is clearly false and leads to
statements such as \verb+1 = 2+. One can understand the difference
between $\bnd{x}{e}{c}$ and $\dcl{x}{e}{c}$ as the difference between
\emph{variables}, defined through substitution, and \emph{assignables}
which are defined by the site in which they are bound. The former is
like a let-binding while the latter is closer to a declaration in
C. In our language this separation exists which is why the operators
for reading and writing a mutable cell are indexed by symbol rather
than taking an arbitrary term. There is much to be said on the subject
of symbols and, more generally, nominal binding but it is sadly
out-of-scope for this discussion. The interested reader is referred
to~\citep{Pitts:13}.

The static semantics of the language are divided into three judgments,
the first of which is the judgment ensuring a type is a
well-formed. Informally, a type is well formed in a context $\Delta$
if $\Delta$ contains all the free variables of the type.
\begin{mathpar}
  \declareJudgement{\hasTJ{}{\Delta}{\tau}{\tp}}\\
  \inferrule{
    \alpha \in \Delta
  }{\hasTJ{}{\Delta}{\alpha}{\tp}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasTJ{}{\Delta}{\tau_1}{\tp}\\
    \hasTJ{}{\Delta}{\tau_2}{\tp}
  }{\hasTJ{}{\Delta}{\fn{\tau_1}{\tau_2}}{\tp}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasTJ{}{\Delta, \alpha}{\tau}{\tp}
  }{\hasTJ{}{\Delta}{\allNoKind{\alpha}{\tau}}{\tp}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasTJ{}{\Delta}{\tau}{\tp}
  }{\hasTJ{}{\Delta}{\cmd{\tau}}{\tp}}
\end{mathpar}
In order to explain the statics of expressions and commands two
judgments are necessary and they must depend on each other. This
mutual dependence is a result of the $\cmd{-}$ modality which
internalizes the command judgment. First the expression judgment is
given, it is completely standard except that it must also be fibered
over a specification of the available assignables. This extra context
is necessary in order to make sense of the binding done in
$\mathsf{dcl}$.
\begin{mathpar}
  \declareJudgement{\hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e}{\tau}}\\
  \inferrule{
    x : \tau \in \Gamma
  }{\hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{x}{\tau}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma, x : \tau_1}{\Sigma}{e}{\tau_2}
  }{\hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\lam{x}{\tau_1}{e}}{\fn{\tau_1}{\tau_2}}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e_1}{\fn{\tau_1}{\tau_2}}\\
    \hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e_2}{\tau_1}\\
  }{\hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\ap{e_1}{e_2}}{\tau_2}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasESigJ{\Delta, \alpha}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e}{\tau}
  }{\hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\LamNoKind{\alpha}{e}}{\allNoKind{\alpha}{\tau}}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e}{\allNoKind{\alpha}{\tau_1}}\\
    \hasTJ{}{\Delta}{\tau_2}{\tp}
  }{\hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\Ap{e}{\tau_2}}{[\tau_2/\alpha]\tau_1}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasMJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{m}{\tau}
  }{\hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e}{\tau}}
\end{mathpar}
These are the rules of System F with the exception of the final
one. This makes use of the judgment for commands, where
$\hasM{m}{\tau}$ signifies that $m$ is a command which (when executed
on the appropriate heap) will run to a $\ret{v}$ for some
$\hasE{v}{\tau}$. It is worth noting that $\Sigma$ in this judgment is
unimportant except in this rule as well. It is only necessary to track
the available assignables because without this information it is not
possible to determine if a command is well-typed. The rules for
commands are as follows.
\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule{
    \hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e}{\tau}
  }{\hasMJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\ret{e}}{\tau}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \alpha \div \tau \in \Sigma
  }{\hasMJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\get{\alpha}}{\tau}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \alpha \div \tau \in \Sigma\\
    \hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e}{\tau}
  }{\hasMJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\set{\alpha}{e}}{\tau}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e}{\tau_2}\\
    \hasMJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma, \alpha : \tau_2}{m}{\tau_1}
  }{\hasMJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\dcl{\alpha}{e}{m}}{\tau_1}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e}{\cmd{\tau_1}}\\
    \hasMJ{\Delta}{\Gamma, x : \tau_1}{\Sigma}{m}{\tau_2}
  }{\hasMJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\bnd{x}{e}{m}}{\tau_2}}\and
\end{mathpar}
The operational semantics of this language can be presented in two
distinct ways differing in the way that the allocation of a fresh heap
cell is done. In classical literature, an expression is evaluated
using traditional small step semantics. Commands in this framework are
evaluated by a small step semantics as well but the relation is
between configurations, not just commands. A configuration is a pair
$(m, h)$, a command and the heap it is running on. In
\citet{Harper:16} the binding structure of symbols is preserved in the
operational semantics so that a running command is represented as a
configuration $\nu \Sigma.\ (m, h)$ where $\Sigma$ is a collection of
symbols bound in both $m$ and $h$.

The advantage of this presentation is that it eliminates the choice of
how to pick a fresh symbol during allocation. Allocated assignables
are bound and so they automatically $\alpha$-vary to avoid collisions
with other assignables. In the more traditional set up the stepping
relation nondeterministic, allowing for any fresh location to be
chosen. This nondeterminism complicates many metatheoretic properties
and obscures what is really happening since the language is
fundamentally not nondeterministic! The formal presentation has just
obscured the precise meaning of a construct and approximated it with
nondeterminism. For the problems discussed in this thesis, however,
this advantage is not significant and it proves to be (while not
impossible) onerous to convert from semantic objects to $\Sigma$ when
running programs. Indeed a slightly different presentation from Harper
would be required in any case since programs will be run on heaps
containing locations varying over not syntactic but semantic
types. This means for expository purposes the traditional operational
semantics are chosen.

This gives a precise account of the language which we want to
construct a logical relation for. Still undefined, however, is the
notion of equivalence that this logical relation should capture. It
was informally sketched in the introduction as the ability to replace
one program with the other in an arbitrary context. It is now possible
to make this definition formal. First, a context is a term with a
distinguished hole in it, written $\hole$. They are generated from the
following grammar:
\[
  \begin{array}{lcl}
    C &::=& \hole \mid \ap{C}{e} \mid \ap{e}{C} \mid \lam{x}{\tau}{C} \mid
            \LamNoKind{\alpha}{C} \mid \Ap{C}{c} \mid \cmd{C_m}\\
    C_m &::=& \ret{C} \mid \bnd{x}{C}{m} \mid \bnd{x}{e}{C_m}\\
      & \mid & \dcl{\alpha}{C}{m} \mid \dcl{\alpha}{e}{C_m} \mid \set{\alpha}{C}\\
    C^m &::=& \ap{C^m}{e} \mid \ap{e}{C^m} \mid \lam{x}{\tau}{C^m} \mid
    \LamNoKind{\alpha}{C^m} \mid \Ap{C^m}{c} \mid \cmd{C_m^m}\\
    C_m^m &::=& \hole \mid \ret{C^m} \mid \bnd{x}{C^m}{m} \mid \bnd{x}{e}{C_m^m}\\
 & \mid & \dcl{\alpha}{C^m}{m} \mid \dcl{\alpha}{e}{C_m^m} \mid \set{\alpha}{C^m}\\
  \end{array}
\]
Two of varieties contexts, $C$ and $C_m$, come equipped with a natural
operation replacing $\hole$ with an expression, denoted $C[e]$, while
the other two possess an identical operation for commands. Notice that
crucially this operation is capturing; $e$ is allowed to make use of
the variables bound in $C$. This is important for allowing contextual
equivalence to work with open terms.

A small point of interest is that having two sorts which may mention
each other leads to four different varieties of contexts. This
quadratic growth continues which makes contextual equivalence
difficult to define for complex languages. This has been addressed in
Crary~\citep{Crary:17} by defining contextual equivalence as the
unique relation satisfying Theorem~\ref{thm:language:cxt}. Finally,
contexts can be equipped with a notion of typing. This typing relation
for a context representing an expression with an expression hole, $C$,
expresses that when filled with a program
$\hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e}{\tau}$ then
$\hasESigJ{\Delta'}{\Gamma'}{\Sigma'}{C[e]}{\tau'}$. This typing
relation is unsurprising and therefore omitted. This judgment is
written as
$\hasCEJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\tau}{C}{\Delta'}{\Gamma'}{\Sigma'}{\tau'}$
if $C$ sends an object of type $\tau$ to an object of type $\tau'$.

In order to define contextual equivalence, two supplementary
definitions are required.
\begin{defn}\label{def:language:heapmatch}
  A heap, $h$, is said to match $\Sigma$, written $h : \Sigma$, if for
  all $\alpha \div \tau \in \Sigma$,
  $\hasESigJ{\cdot}{\cdot}{\Sigma}{h(l)}{\tau}$.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}\label{def:language:kleene}
  To programs are said to be Kleene equal at $\Sigma$, written
  $e_1 \simeq_\Sigma e_2$ if for all $h : \Sigma$ and $m_1, m_2$ so
  that $\steps{e_i}{\cmd{m_i}}$ then $(m_1, h) \Downarrow$ and
  $(m_2, h) \Downarrow$ or $(m_1, h) \Uparrow$ and
  $(m_2, h) \Uparrow$.
\end{defn}
This definition of Kleene equality is slightly non-standard in two
ways: it requires that the expressions are commands and that it only
checks if the resulting commands coterminate, not that they result in
the same value. These deviations are less surprising because without
them Kleene equivalence is unhelpful. There is no base observable type
in this language and so there is no observation to by made besides
termination. Furthermore, it is not hard to prove that expressions
always terminate (they behave as System F with a new base type) so
\emph{no} interesting observations may be made of just
expressions. These facts

We will also make use of the notation $(m_1, h_1) \simeq (m_2, h_2)$
to signify just the final part of this definition. Finally, we can
lift Kleene equality to a definition of contextual equivalence.
\begin{defn}\label{def:language:cxt}
  To programs are contextually equivalent,
  $\equivESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e_1}{e_2}{\tau}$ if for all
  contexts
  $\hasCEJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\tau}{C}{\cdot}{\cdot}{\Sigma'}{\cmd{\tau'}}$,
  $C[e_1] \simeq_{\Sigma'} C[e_2]$.

  Similarly, two commands are said to contextually equivalent if
  $\hasCEJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\tau}{C^m}{\cdot}{\cdot}{\Sigma'}{\cmd{\tau'}}$,
  $C^m[m_1] \simeq_{\Sigma'} C^m[m_2]$.
\end{defn}
This definition formalizes our earlier intuitions and it makes obvious
the issues that were mentioned with contextual equivalence previously.
In order to establish contextual equivalence we must write a proof
which handles an arbitrary choice of $C$, clearly a difficult
task.

Most proofs of contextual equivalence make use of a coinductive
characterization of it. Contextual equivalence is the coarsest
consistent congruence relation on terms. A consistent relation is one
where if two terms are related by the relation than they
coterminate. A congruence relation is an equivalence relation
(reflexive, symmetric, transitive) which respects the structure of the
terms. To make this precise, a pair of relations $(\relR, \relS)$ is
said to respect the structure of terms if the following inferences are
valid.
\begin{mathparpagebreakable}
  \inferrule{
    e_1 \relR e_2
  }{\lam{x}{\tau}{e_1} \relR \lam{x}{\tau}{e_2}}\and
  \inferrule{
    e_1 \relR e_1'\\
    e_2 \relR e_2'
  }{\ap{e_1}{e_2} \relR \ap{e_1'}{e_2'}}\and
  \inferrule{
    e_1 \relR e_2
  }{\LamNoKind{\alpha}{e_1} \relR \LamNoKind{\alpha}{e_2}}\and
  \inferrule{
    e_1 \relR e_2
  }{\Ap{e_1}{c} \relR \Ap{e_2}{c}}\and
  \inferrule{
    m_1 \relS m_2
  }{\cmd{m_1} \relR \cmd{m_2}}\and
  \inferrule{
    e_1 \relR e_2
  }{\ret{e_1} \relS \ret{e_2}}\and
  \inferrule{
    e_1 \relR e_2\\
    m_1 \relS m_2
  }{\bnd{x}{e_1}{m_1} \relS \bnd{x}{e_2}{m_2}}\and
  \inferrule{
    e_1 \relR e_2\\
    m_1 \relS m_2
  }{\dcl{\alpha}{e_1}{m_1} \relS \dcl{\alpha}{e_2}{m_2}}\and
  \inferrule{
    e_1 \relR e_2\\
  }{\set{\alpha}{e_1} \relS \set{\alpha}{e_2}}\and
  \inferrule{
  }{\get{\alpha} \relS \get{\alpha}}
\end{mathparpagebreakable}
The standard result is then captured by the following theorem.
\begin{thm}\label{thm:language:cxt}
  Contextual equivalence on expressions and commands is the coarsest
  consistent congruence.
\end{thm}
This concludes the discussion of the language under consideration. We
now turn to discussing logical relations for this language.
